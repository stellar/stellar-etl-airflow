# Background process that copies extracts to gcsfuse mount on airflow-workers
#
# Author: Debnil Sur
# Date: October 2020
#
# This script is a long running background process on the airflow-worker
# nodes. It listens for the existing of new files in the /home/airflow/etlData
# directory, which is where data is exported using the stellar-etl framework.
# If the file is complete and closed, the script moves the file to the correct
# gcsfused mount, meaning that it is copied across all workers so that downstream
# Airflow tasks can reference the file.
#
# Follow the directions in the README.md to get the script mapped and executing
# on the airflow-worker nodes.
