'''
The process_unbounded_core DAG reads information from the unbounded_core_export DAG. The unbounded_core_export exports 
data in batches to a folder as the network progresses. The process_unbounded_core DAG uses file sensors to read these
batches as they are written. Once a batch is read, it is loaded into Google Cloud Storage and loaded into BigQuery.
This DAG is scheduled to run once, and it triggers a new run with the trigger_next every time a batch is processed.
